# Initial Mapping Consideraiton
## For Knowhax 2024 Team 38
#### The ability to upload csv of names and institutions and find related works and connect HBCUs


This folder is a sample subsection of an overall potential enhancement to the CollabNext project which would include the ability to plot and visualize the geographical mapping of the connections .
The appMap.py is a flask app that will run and start a server which right now may take a bit due to the sample data in place but with the help of Gen AI tools, the code
will provide a way for a person to take either data from an input, csv upload, or map selection and pass it to the sparQL queries currently in place. This represents
a sample connection between the current functioning process and an intermediatary step that can occur before or after. What is not fully include is the geocoding step which
would occur through the OSM Overpass API.
